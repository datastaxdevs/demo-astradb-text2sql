    "Few-Shot prompting has been a technique for a few years, since LLMs were first conceived. The theory behind few-shot prompting (also known as \"In-Context Learning\") is that we are showing the model examples of our desired input/output pairs, and guiding the model to make decisions more in line with what we expect for the task at hand. Since the original GPT-3 paper, [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), few-shot methods have been shown to greatly improve performance over zero-shot methods (aka no examples in the prompt). Because of this, let's see how our model does if we give it a few examples of correct output."
